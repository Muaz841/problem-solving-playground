# Problem-Solving Playground 🚀

This repo is just my little C++ coding playground.  
I drop random practice problems here — nothing too serious, just experimenting and learning.  

Sometimes on weekends, I like to pick up a few problems and try out solutions.  
Some code might be clean, some messy, but all part of the journey. 😅

## 📝 Notes
- Most of these are solved in **DevC++**.  
- Commit messages are short & simple (e.g. *"two sum solution"*).  
- This is more like my coding diary than a polished project.

⭐ Just a casual repo to track progress and have fun with problem solving!
